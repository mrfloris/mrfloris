### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a thing I do, nice to meet you. Please forgive me for learning.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to make it through a day, so I can make it to the next. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on improving everything I do in life, so feel free to give me suggestions. Eventually I will get around to it. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with CMI project, figuring out how to best add a wide variety of emotes into the game. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I only trust four people in my life, but fully trust your insights and contributions to what I do daily.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @floris on Twitter, or floris#0233 on Discord.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: People call me floris, mrfloris, I am not fund of nicknames beyond that.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The rabbit hole goes deeper than you might ever realise. Please be kind to others.
