# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm involved in various endeavors, and it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please bear with me as I continue to learn and grow.

## Some info

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm engrossed in several projects, where I share my thoughts on my personal website [MRF](https://github.com/mrfdev/MRF), manage Minecraft servers like [1MB](https://github.com/mrfdev/1MB), provide support for [CMI](https://github.com/mrfdev/CMI), and administer online forums like [OMG](https://github.com/mrfdev/OMG).
- ðŸŒ± My present focus is on getting through each day, taking one step at a time.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm eager to collaborate with others to enhance every aspect of my life. If you have any suggestions related to my GitHub projects, I'll be sure to address them when I can find the time.
- ðŸ¤” I could use some help with the CMI project, specifically in figuring out the best approach to incorporate a wide variety of emotes into the game.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me why I only trust four people in my life, while fully trusting your insights and contributions to what I do daily.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Twitter as [@floris](https://twitter.com/floris) or on Discord as [@mrfloris](https://discord.gg/floris).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Most people refer to me as floris or mrfloris, and I don't particularly fancy nicknames beyond those.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The rabbit hole goes deeper than you might ever realize. Please remember to be kind to others. [.](https://creations.nl)
